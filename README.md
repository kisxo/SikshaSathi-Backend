# AI-Powered Smart Education Platform

This project is a **RAG and GEN-AI based education assistant system** designed to help students plan, learn, and track their progress in a unified digital platform.

The system uses **Python FastAPI** to create REST APIs, **React Native** for the Android application, and **React** for the web application. It provides tools for systematic planning, resource generation, and progress tracking â€” all within a smart, mobile-first interface.

A notable feature includes **smart email summaries** generated via GEN-AI, keeping students informed without manual effort.
